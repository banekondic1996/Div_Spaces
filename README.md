Not really being worked on. I got so angry at Google Chrome not saving when inspecting the page, so i made this.
Uploaded program is just preview of editor. It uses NW.JS, i haven't uploaded package.json it only needs nw.js for now

Needs to be done:
1. Text editor that supports code syntax
2. Focus on text inside code when clicking on element
3. Support for external CSS files
4. Working redo and undo buttons
5. Fixing style attribute editing in CSS editor panel
